# Introduction 

A friend was recently using R's built-in [USArrests](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html) dataset to experiment with R's mapping functions. Since that dataset is from the 1970s I decided to try and find something more timely. I stumbled upon Quandl's [US State Violent Crime Rate](https://www.quandl.com/data/FBI_UCR/USCRIME_TYPE_VIOLENTCRIMERATE-U-S-Crimes-by-crime-Violent-Crime-Rate) dataset and decided to explore it in more depth. I looked at the dataset using three statistical techniques: Boxplots, Maps and Time Series.

The code for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/arilamstein/state-crime-analysis). If you have any comments or notice any errors, please contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/AriLamstein).

# Boxplots

The dataset is aggregated by state and by year. My first step was to create a [boxplot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) of the data by year. This led me to the surprising conclusion that Washington, DC is an outlier: its violent crime rate is significantly higher than that of other regions in the dataset.

Viewing the graphs with and without Washington, DC shows just how much of an outlier it is. Also, there is a clear increase in violent crime from 1960 to the mid 1990s, followed by a gradual decrease.
