As the author of an [R mapping package](https://github.com/arilamstein/choroplethr) I am always on the lookout for interesting datasets that lend themselves to mapping. I recently stumbled across the [US State Violent Crime Rate](https://www.quandl.com/data/FBI_UCR/USCRIME_TYPE_VIOLENTCRIMERATE-U-S-Crimes-by-crime-Violent-Crime-Rate) dataset and decided to explore it in more depth.

The dataset is aggregated by state and by year. My first step was to create a boxplot of the data by year.  My first surprise was that Washington, DC is an outlier - it seems to regularly have a crime rate that is roughly twice the next highest value.
