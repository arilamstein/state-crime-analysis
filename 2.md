Next I decided to create a choropleth map to explore the regional aspects of the data. Boxplots are great for understanding distributions, but choropleth maps help you to understand which values go where, and whether certain regions of the country tend to have certain values. 

Because this dataset covers several years, I made the map interactive. In addition to choosing which year to view, you can also zoom in on certain states as well as change the number of colors used.
